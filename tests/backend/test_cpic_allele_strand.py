"""Strand-orientation guard for CPIC star-allele definitions.

Yeliztli's pharmacogenomics caller (``backend/analysis/pharmacogenomics.py``)
compares a 23andMe genotype **directly** to the ``ref``/``alt`` stored for each
star allele in ``cpic_alleles.csv``, with **no strand harmonization**
(:func:`_count_alt_alleles`). 23andMe v3/v4/v5 raw exports report genotypes on
the **GRCh37 plus/forward strand** (per 23andMe's "Raw Genotype Data Technical
Details": genotypes refer to the plus strand of GRCh37, regardless of how dbSNP
defines the SNP). Therefore every defining ``{ref, alt}`` **must** be stored on
the GRCh37 plus strand, with ``alt`` equal to the plus-strand base produced by
the star-allele-*defining* variant (the base a carrier has) and ``ref`` the
plus-strand base of the normal/``*1`` allele.

For genes on the **minus strand** (CYP2D6, CYP3A5, DPYD, TPMT) the CPIC/PharmVar
cDNA defining change (e.g. ``c.2851C>T``) is the **reverse complement** of the
plus strand and must be complemented base-by-base (A<->T, C<->G) while
**preserving the ref/alt roles**. A historical bug stored several minus-strand
rows in cDNA orientation; on real plus-strand data the genotype bases then fell
outside ``{ref, alt}`` and the variant became silently **uncallable**
(a no-call), downgrading carriers to wild-type — a patient-safety defect on
fatal-toxicity (DPYD/5-FU), thiopurine (TPMT), tacrolimus (CYP3A5) and
CYP2D6 drugs.

THE TRAP (do not "fix" with genomic VCF orientation): at a few SNPs the GRCh37
reference genome itself carries the *variant/defining* allele (e.g. rs16947 ref
base = A = the ``*2`` allele; rs776746 ref base = C = the ``*3`` allele). A plain
genomic VCF lists REF=reference-genome-base, but using that as the engine
``alt`` is backwards and would call the star allele for ``*1`` carriers. The
engine ``alt`` must remain the *defining* base.

Each ``(ref, alt)`` below was verified against the **Ensembl GRCh37 REST API**
(forward-strand ``allele_string``), **dbSNP** RefSNP SPDI (plus strand of the
GRCh37 RefSeq contig), and the **PharmVar/CPIC** allele-definition cDNA changes.
This test pins those values so the strand bug cannot regress: any new
single-base defining variant must be added here (forcing the same verification)
or explicitly acknowledged in ``KNOWN_NON_SNV``.
