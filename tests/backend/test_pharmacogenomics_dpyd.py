"""DPYD fluoropyrimidine panel — activity-score phenotypes + safety caveat (SW-E5).

These tests load the REAL production CPIC tables (``backend/data/cpic/*.csv``) so
they validate the shipped, plus-strand-corrected DPYD allele definitions, the
enumerated activity-score diplotypes (incl. compound heterozygotes that were
previously dropped), and the absent-allele / fatal-toxicity caveat attached to
DPYD prescribing alerts.

DPYD uses CPIC's gene Activity Score (sum of the two allele activity values):
AS 2.0 -> Normal, 1.0/1.5 -> Intermediate, 0.0/0.5 -> Poor Metabolizer.
All genotypes below are GRCh37 plus/forward strand (as real 23andMe data is).
