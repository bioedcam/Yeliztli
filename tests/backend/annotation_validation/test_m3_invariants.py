"""M3 — Property invariants over the live pipeline.

These are assertions that must hold after *any* annotation of *any* sample.
Some are standing regression guards that pass today; the rest encode
post-remediation behaviour and are ``xfail(strict=True)`` until their phase
lands (the strict marker means an early/accidental fix is surfaced immediately).

Invariants are sourced from ``docs/annotation-validation-strategy.md`` §4-M3.
``inv5`` (coverage-bit ⇔ source column) and ``inv8`` (deleterious denominator)
live in ``test_m6_coverage.py`` / ``test_m5_refdata_qa.py`` respectively, where
the supporting fixtures already exist.
