"""Strand-aware allele matching for weighted scoring and risk-genotype calling.

The single home for strand/allele harmonization logic, shared by:

  - the PRS engine (:mod:`backend.analysis.prs`), via
    :func:`match_effect_allele_dosage` — counts effect-allele dosage for a
    published weight set, harmonizing the weight's allele frame against the
    chip's observed genotype; and
  - the by-rsID risk-genotype caller (:mod:`backend.analysis.risk_genotype`),
    via :func:`risk_dosage` / :func:`canonical_alleles` — counts copies of a
    curated risk allele, resolving the cross-vendor minus-strand pitfalls that
    bite monogenic risk loci (Factor V Leiden ``rs6025`` and Prothrombin
    ``rs1799963`` are reported on the minus strand by 23andMe).

Why this is necessary (EXPANSION_STRATEGY.md §10): the array's reported alleles
are on the chip *design* strand, which is sometimes the reverse strand relative
to the reference genome (and therefore relative to GWAS summary stats / ClinVar,
which are on the ``+`` strand). Raw string-matching an effect allele against the
genotype silently inverts the dosage for any opposite-strand weight set — the #1
source of a wrong PRS. ``annotated_variants.strand`` is the VEP *transcript*
strand (gene orientation) and is useless for this; the only reliable signals are
allele-set comparison (reference strand then Watson–Crick complement) plus the
allele frequency for the strand-ambiguous palindromes.

Harmonization mirrors the canonical bigsnpr ``snp_match`` discipline (Privé 2022,
*HGG Advances*; doi:10.1016/j.xhgg.2022.100136): match on the allele pair, allow
an opposite-strand ``_FLIP_`` via complement, and **drop strand-ambiguous A/T &
C/G SNPs whose minor-allele frequency is in [0.40, 0.60]** — near 0.5 the
frequency cannot disambiguate which strand the genotype is on, so scoring it
would be a coin flip.

The genotype is treated as ground truth and never flipped; it is the foreign
weight-set allele frame that we resolve *into* the chip's representation, so
downstream zygosity / QC stay consistent.

    Behaviour depends on whether the weight set supplies the ``other_allele``:

    - **With ``other_allele``** (modern PGS-Catalog-style weights): full
      harmonization. The ``{effect, other}`` pair is matched against the observed
      alleles on the reference strand, then on the complemented strand (flipping
      the effect allele). Strand-ambiguous palindromes (``other == complement(
      effect)``) near MAF 0.5 are dropped per the bigsnpr rule; away from 0.5
      they are taken at face value on the ``+`` strand (frequency resolves them).

    - **Without ``other_allele``** (legacy curated weights, e.g. the four
      hand-curated cancer scores): a strict back-compatible literal count — the
      effect allele is counted as-is with no strand attempt. A reverse-strand
      flip is genuinely undecidable from a lone effect allele, so guessing would
      *introduce* the inversion this function exists to prevent. This reproduces
      the historical ``_count_effect_allele`` math byte-for-byte.

    Args:
        genotype: Two-char (or haploid one-char) genotype string, or None.
        effect_allele: The allele the weight is expressed for.
