"""APOE genotype determination and findings generation.

Implements P3-22a: Determine the APOE diplotype from two defining SNPs.
Implements P3-22b: Generate three APOE findings (CV risk, Alzheimer's, lipid/dietary).

APOE alleles are defined by combinations at two positions on chromosome 19:
  - rs429358 (codon 112): T→C corresponds to Cys→Arg
  - rs7412   (codon 158): C→T corresponds to Arg→Cys

Haplotype definitions (forward-strand alleles):
  - ε2: rs429358=T + rs7412=T  (Cys112, Cys158)
  - ε3: rs429358=T + rs7412=C  (Cys112, Arg158)  ← reference/common
  - ε4: rs429358=C + rs7412=C  (Arg112, Arg158)

Both SNPs are on the 23andMe v5 array, so no partial-call ambiguity.

Usage::

    from backend.analysis.apoe import determine_apoe_genotype, APOEResult

    result = determine_apoe_genotype(sample_engine)
    print(result.diplotype)   # e.g. "ε3/ε4"
    print(result.has_e4)      # True
    print(result.e4_count)    # 1
