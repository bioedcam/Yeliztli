"""Strand- and order-aware genotype lookup for categorical panel scoring.

Every categorical-scoring module (nutrigenomics, gene_health, traits, fitness,
sleep, methylation, skin, allergy) resolves a curated effect by the sample's
genotype string via ``snp.genotype_effects.get(genotype)``. Two representations
of the *same* genotype must resolve to the same entry:

  - **Allele order** — a chip may report ``"TC"`` where the panel keys ``"CT"``
    (and ``"G/delG"`` where the panel keys ``"delG/G"`` for slash-delimited
    indel calls).
  - **Strand** — a genotyping chip reports alleles on its *design* strand, which
    for some SNPs is the reverse strand relative to the panel's curated keys. The
    flagship case is MTHFR C677T (``rs1801133``): 23andMe reports it as ``C``/``T``
    but the panel keys ``genotype_effects`` on the ``G``/``A`` (Watson–Crick
    complement) strand. Matching only the raw string silently drops such carriers
    to the default category.

``lookup_by_genotype`` tries candidates **reference strand first, complement as a
fallback** (so an already-matching genotype is never re-strand-flipped), each in
both allele orders. This mirrors the ref-then-complement discipline in
:mod:`backend.analysis.allele_match`. Non-ACGT genotypes (slash-delimited indels,
``"--"`` no-calls) skip the complement step, since a base complement is undefined
for them.
