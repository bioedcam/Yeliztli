"""Sex-chromosome aneuploidy screen (XXY / Klinefelter pattern) — roadmap #48.

Array genotypes can detect exactly one sex-chromosome aneuploidy with reasonable
confidence: **XXY** (Klinefelter). The signature is heterozygous non-PAR
chromosome-X calls (which require ≥2 X chromosomes) co-occurring with a present
chromosome Y. Everything else is out of reach from genotype calls alone and is
stated as such:

  - **45,X (Turner)** and **XYY** need DNA-quantity / probe-intensity (LRR/BAF)
    data, which a genotype-only export does not carry — so they are NOT screened
    (no false reassurance, no copy-number claims, §12.5).
  - **XXX** also shows heterozygous X without a Y; it cannot be distinguished
    from a typical XX from genotypes, so it is not asserted.

Guardrails:
  - This is a **screen, not a diagnosis** — a positive result is framed for
    confirmation by clinical karyotyping.
  - It **never overwrites** the recorded biological sex.
  - It requires a minimum number of typed non-PAR X and Y probes before judging
    either chromosome, so a single stray Y probe on an XX sample cannot produce a
    false XXY call; thin data yields ``indeterminate``.
  - Surfaced behind an opt-in gate (psychosocial weight) — see
    :mod:`backend.api.routes.sex_aneuploidy`.
