"""Shared responsible-return framing (SW-A1 / roadmap #10) — §12.3 / §12.10.

One home for the two load-bearing return-of-results statements so they read
identically everywhere they surface:

  - **PRS** results are *research-only*, must carry their **source population**,
    and their **bootstrap CI is always paired** with the percentile — an explicit
    "CI unavailable" rather than a bare point estimate.
  - An actionable **ClinVar Pathogenic / Likely-pathogenic** result is
    array-derived and must be **confirmed in a CLIA/accredited lab** with genetic
    counseling before any medical action (mirrors the APOE-gate framing).

These are additive disclosure helpers: they never change a score, percentile,
CI, evidence level, or ClinVar significance.
