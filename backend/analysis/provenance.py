"""Per-finding provenance + version pinning (SW-A4 / roadmap #8).

A post-run pass that stamps every finding with the *release snapshot* used to
produce it: the source-database versions and genome builds (ClinVar / gnomAD /
dbNSFP / CPIC / VEP, read from ``database_versions`` — F30 supplies the build),
the variant's variation IDs, its ``annotation_coverage`` bitmask, and the
pipeline version. This makes each finding self-describing for audit and
reproducibility, and is the substrate a later "finding changed" diff builds on.

Audit metadata only: stamping never reads or changes ``evidence_level`` /
``clinvar_significance`` — it writes one new ``findings.provenance`` JSON column.
Runs once after ``run_all_analyses`` (best-effort, in the Huey scheduler), so all
of a sample's findings share one consistent release snapshot.
