"""Parkinson's disease risk module (LRRK2 G2019S) — roadmap #41.

Thin adapter over the shared declarative risk-genotype caller for the single
directly-typed Parkinson's risk variant we can reliably call from an array:
LRRK2 G2019S (rs34637584). The finding is surfaced behind an **APOE-style ethical
opt-in gate** (see :mod:`backend.api.routes.parkinsons`) and stored at
``evidence_level 2`` so it does not auto-surface in the ungated dashboard
high-confidence section (which filters ``evidence_level >= 3``).

Honesty / ethics guardrails (§12.6, §12.10):
  - **Reduced, age-dependent penetrance** — ~25-42.5% lifetime risk by age 80;
    most carriers never develop Parkinson's. A positive call is never a diagnosis
    or a prediction.
  - **No preventive treatment** — there is no proven prevention, so the result is
    not actionable in a treatment sense; its value is personal (awareness, family
    planning, research). Routed to genetic counseling / CLIA confirmation.
  - **GBA1 is deliberately not reported.** The adjacent GBAP1 pseudogene makes
    array (and short-read) GBA1 genotyping unreliable, so GBA1 risk variants are
    suppressed here rather than reported as low-confidence calls. This is stated
    in the disclaimer; only LRRK2 G2019S is in the panel.

Findings carry ``clinvar_significance=NULL`` (a common reduced-penetrance risk
variant, not a deterministic ClinVar call).
