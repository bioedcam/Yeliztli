"""Finding-level change diff (SW-A4b / roadmap #8).

The provenance core (SW-A4) pins every finding to the source releases that
produced it. This module builds on that foundation: after a sample is
re-annotated, it surfaces *what changed at the finding level* since the previous
analysis — findings that were added, removed, or whose meaning shifted (e.g.
"BRCA1: VUS → Pathogenic") — attributed to the source-release delta recorded in
provenance.

It generalises the existing *variant-level* watched-variant reclassification
banner into a *whole-sample, every-finding* diff.

Disclosure only. The diff never reads or alters ``evidence_level`` /
``clinvar_significance`` / carriage — it reports what the upstream releases
changed. The honest framing is "this changed because the ClinVar release
advanced," never "your risk increased."

Design (Option A — no schema change). Findings are deleted and re-inserted on
every run, so the prior findings are snapshotted *in memory* before
``run_all_analyses`` clears them; after the fresh findings are stamped with
provenance, the diff is computed against that snapshot and stored as a JSON blob
in the per-sample ``annotation_state`` kv table under ``last_finding_diff_json``.

A finding's identity across runs is the stable composite key
``(module, category, gene_symbol, rsid, drug, diplotype)`` — the columns that pin
"the same biological statement," excluding the volatile ``id`` / ``created_at`` /
``provenance`` and the free-text ``finding_text``.
