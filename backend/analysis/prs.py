"""Generic Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) calculator engine.

Implements P3-14: a reusable PRS engine that computes scores from
published weight sets. Designed to be consumed by cancer (P3-15),
traits & personality (P3-63), and any future PRS-based module.

Key design decisions (from PRD):
  - Weight sets tagged with source GWAS ancestry and sample size.
  - Scores expressed as population percentile + z-score (never raw PRS
    value or absolute lifetime risk).
  - Bootstrap CI (1000 iterations, 95% confidence) for uncertainty.
  - Ancestry mismatch warning field on every result (for P3-16).
  - "Research Use Only" tier — PRS findings are never displayed
    alongside monogenic ClinVar findings.
