"""Source-deletion cascade service (AncestryDNA Plan §10.8; Step 66 / MRG-02a).

Deleting a sample that any ``merge_provenance.source_sample_ids`` JSON array
references must cascade: every merged child is destroyed first (DB file +
reference row), then the source row + DB. The walk lives in one module so
every ``DELETE`` path uses identical semantics — Plan §10.8 declares the
cascade as the contract, not the route layout.

The traversal is O(N) over rows where ``samples.file_format == 'merged_v1'``
because ``merge_provenance`` is a single-row table inside the *merged
sample's* per-sample DB (Plan §10.4 c), not the reference DB. Real installs
carry a handful of merged samples, so opening each per-sample DB once per
deletion is acceptable.

Defensive contract: a half-broken install (missing DB file, malformed JSON,
unreadable engine) is *logged and skipped*, never raised. The user-facing
DELETE flow must keep working when the registry is partially corrupt — the
single-confirmation cascade in the UI is the only place a user can recover
the orphaned rows from.
