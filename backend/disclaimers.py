GLOBAL_DISCLAIMER_TITLE = "Important Information About Yeliztli"

GLOBAL_DISCLAIMER_TEXT = """\
Yeliztli is an educational and research tool designed to help you \
explore your personal genomic data. It is NOT a medical device and has \
NOT been reviewed or approved by the FDA or any regulatory authority.

Please read and understand the following before proceeding:

1. **Not a diagnostic tool.** The information provided by Yeliztli \
is for educational and research purposes only. It should not be used to \
diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition.

2. **Not a substitute for professional medical advice.** Always consult \
a qualified healthcare provider or certified genetic counselor before \
making any medical decisions based on genetic information. Do not \
disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of \
something you have read in this application.

3. **Variant interpretation has limitations.** Genetic variant \
classifications change over time as scientific understanding evolves. \
A variant classified as "benign" today may be reclassified in the \
future, and vice versa. Yeliztli uses publicly available databases \
that may not reflect the most current scientific consensus.

4. **Genotyping chip limitations.** Consumer genotyping chips (such as \
23andMe) test only a subset of genetic variants. A negative result does \
not mean you do not carry a particular variant — it may simply not have \
been tested. Clinical-grade genetic testing is required for definitive \
diagnostic results.

5. **Population-specific considerations.** Risk scores and frequency \
data may not be equally accurate across all ancestral populations. Many \
genetic studies have been conducted primarily in populations of European \
descent, which may limit the applicability of results to other groups.

6. **Privacy responsibility.** You are responsible for the security of \
your own genetic data. Yeliztli runs locally on your computer and \
does not transmit your genetic data to external servers (except for \
optional PubMed literature lookups which send gene names only, never \
variant data).

7. **Emotional preparedness.** Genetic information may reveal unexpected \
findings about health risks, carrier status, or ancestry. Consider \
whether you are prepared to receive potentially sensitive information \
before proceeding.

# ── Carrier status disclaimer ──────────────────────────────────────────

CARRIER_STATUS_DISCLAIMER_TITLE = "About Carrier Status Results"

CARRIER_STATUS_DISCLAIMER_TEXT = """\
Carrier status results indicate whether you carry one copy (heterozygous) \
of a variant associated with a genetic condition. Carriers typically do \
not show symptoms of the condition themselves.

**This information is most relevant in a reproductive context.** If both \
partners carry a variant in the same autosomal recessive gene, there is \
a 25% chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected by the \
condition. This is the basis of carrier screening in family planning.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **Carrier ≠ affected.** Being a carrier means you have one working \
copy and one non-working copy of a gene. For autosomal recessive \
conditions (such as Cystic Fibrosis, Sickle Cell Disease, Tay-Sachs, \
Gaucher Disease, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy), carriers are typically \
healthy and unaffected.

2. **BRCA1/BRCA2 are a special case.** These genes follow autosomal \
dominant inheritance for cancer predisposition. A single pathogenic \
variant confers personal cancer risk (see the Cancer module) AND \
reproductive carrier risk. Both perspectives are shown in Yeliztli \
with distinct framing.

3. **Genotyping chip limitations.** Consumer genotyping chips test only \
a subset of known variants in each gene. A negative carrier result does \
NOT guarantee that you are not a carrier. Clinical-grade carrier \
screening (expanded carrier panels with full gene sequencing) is \
recommended for comprehensive reproductive planning.

4. **Population-specific carrier frequencies.** Some conditions are more \
common in certain ancestral populations (e.g., Tay-Sachs in Ashkenazi \
Jewish populations, Sickle Cell in African descent populations). The \
carrier panel used here is not population-specific — consult a genetic \
counselor for ancestry-informed screening recommendations.

5. **Professional genetic counseling is recommended.** If you have a \
carrier finding, a certified genetic counselor can help you understand \
the implications for family planning, discuss partner testing options, \
and explain reproductive alternatives.

1. **Predisposition is not diagnosis.** Carrying a pathogenic variant in \
a cancer predisposition gene means you may have an increased lifetime \

This section reports the HFE genotype (C282Y / H63D) associated with hereditary \
haemochromatosis — a treatable disorder of iron metabolism.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **Genotype is not diagnosis, and penetrance is reduced and sex-dependent.** \
Even C282Y homozygotes — the highest-risk genotype — do not all develop disease. \
Cumulative haemochromatosis diagnosis by age 80 was ~56% in men and ~41% in \
women, and most homozygotes are undiagnosed. Compound C282Y/H63D and single \
carriers are low-penetrance.

2. **It is treatable.** When iron overload does occur, it is managed effectively \

(ferritin, transferrin saturation) with a clinician — not a reason to assume disease.

3. **Ancestry context.** Prevalence and penetrance figures come from \

Factor V Leiden (rs6025) and Prothrombin G20210A (rs1799963) — that modestly \
raise the risk of venous blood clots (venous thromboembolism, VTE).

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **Relative risk is not absolute risk.** These variants raise *relative* risk \
(roughly 3–5× for a single Factor V Leiden allele, 2–3× for Prothrombin, ~5× for \
both together), but the *absolute* lifetime risk for most carriers stays low — \
only about 10% of Factor V Leiden carriers ever have a clot.

2. **Risk concentrates around triggers.** Most clots in carriers occur with \
estrogen-containing contraception or hormone therapy, pregnancy and the weeks \
after delivery, major surgery, or prolonged immobility. These are the situations \
worth discussing with a clinician.

3. **Carriers are not treated for being carriers.** Asymptomatic carriers are \
not put on blood thinners, and routine population screening is not recommended.

4. **A negative result does not rule out a clotting disorder.** Many other \

*actionable* condition affecting the lungs and liver.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **The severe genotype is actionable.** PiZZ (two Z alleles) gives severe \
deficiency and raises the risk of early-onset emphysema/COPD and liver disease. \
The single most important step is avoiding smoking and vaping; augmentation \
therapy and liver monitoring may be options to discuss with a clinician.

2. **Genotype is not diagnosis.** Many carriers — and even some with deficiency \
genotypes — remain healthy, particularly non-smokers. Serum AAT level and Pi \
phenotyping confirm and quantify deficiency.

3. **A negative result does not exclude rare null alleles.** The array tests only \

This section reports two common AMD risk alleles — CFH Y402H (rs1061170) and \
ARMS2/HTRA1 (rs10490924). These are common genetic risk factors, not pathogenic \
mutations, and they describe an *association* with age-related macular \
degeneration — not a diagnosis.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **Relative risk is not absolute risk.** The odds ratios shown (up to ~7× for \
CFH and ~5.5× for ARMS2 homozygotes, and an illustrative ~33× for the \
double-homozygous genotype, n=14, with a very wide confidence interval) are \
*relative* odds from case-control studies. Your absolute, lifetime AMD risk \
depends much more on age, smoking, and your overall genetic background.

2. **These two loci are not the whole picture.** A genome-wide study found that \
52 variants across 34 loci explain ~47% (95% CI 44.5–48.8%) of advanced-AMD \
variability in European-ancestry subjects — just under half — and that ~47% is \
attributable to all 52 variants, not to CFH and ARMS2 alone. Most of AMD's \
heritability and most of a person's actual risk lie outside these two SNPs.

3. **Ancestry context.** These odds ratios are derived primarily from \
European-ancestry populations and attenuate in East Asian populations.

4. **A negative result does not rule out AMD risk.** Other AMD variants and \

APOL1_DISCLAIMER_TEXT = """\
This section reports the APOL1 G1 (rs73885319 / rs60910145) and G2 (rs71785313) \
kidney-risk variants and the N264K (rs73885316) modifier. These variants arose \
on, and are validated in, recent African-ancestry genetic backgrounds and are \
near-absent in other populations.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **Ancestry-specific.** This module is reported as actionable only for \
individuals of inferred African ancestry. The G1/G2 alleles are essentially \
absent elsewhere, and the risk estimates were established in African-ancestry \
cohorts. For other inferred ancestries, no actionable high-risk result is shown.

2. **Recessive — two risk alleles are needed.** Increased kidney-disease risk \
requires two risk alleles (any combination of G1 and G2). Carrying a single \
risk allele does not raise risk.

3. **Relative risk, with incomplete penetrance.** The two-risk-allele genotype \
is associated with higher odds of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (OR ~10.5) \
and hypertension-attributed end-stage kidney disease (OR ~7.3), but these are \
*relative* odds. Most people with the high-risk genotype never develop kidney \
disease; a 'second hit' (such as an interferon-driven inflammatory state or \
certain infections) is usually involved. This is not a diagnosis.

4. **The N264K modifier matters.** N264K (rs73885316) strongly attenuates \
G2-associated risk and can reclassify a high-risk genotype toward low risk. If \
N264K was not typed on your array, a high-risk estimate may be overstated.

5. **The G2 variant is a 6-bp deletion often missing from arrays.** When G2 \
(rs71785313) is not typed, your genotype is partial and the risk-allele count \
could be higher than observed — never read a partial result as 'low risk'. \
(Some datasets label this deletion rs1317778148.)

6. **Confirm clinically.** Discuss results with a nephrologist or genetic \

This section reports common urate-transporter risk alleles — ABCG2 Q141K \
(rs2231142) and a SLC2A9 serum-urate variant (rs13129697). These influence how \
much urate the body retains, which relates to gout susceptibility.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **This is a risk modifier, not a diagnosis.** A risk genotype here does not \
mean you have or will develop gout. Gout is multifactorial — many genetic, \
clinical, and lifestyle factors contribute, and most people carrying a risk \
allele never develop gout.

2. **Relative risk, with absolute context.** The ABCG2 Q141K allele is \
associated with roughly 2-fold higher gout odds per risk allele (and larger \
effects in East Asian ancestry), but the absolute lifetime risk for most \
carriers remains modest.

3. **Ancestry context.** The reported effect sizes differ by ancestry; the \
estimate shown is selected for your inferred ancestry where available.

4. **No medical or lifestyle prescriptions.** Yeliztli does not recommend \

represented in the array's reference panel, not a problem with your sample.

2. **The sex check is concordance only.** The genetically inferred sex is \
compared to the sex you recorded, and reported as concordant, discordant, or \
indeterminate. This is a data-integrity check (e.g. catching a mislabeled file). \
It is NOT a sex-chromosome aneuploidy test and never changes your recorded sex.

3. **Call-rate pass line.** A call rate at or above ~98% is the usual array \
threshold; a lower value suggests degraded data and that downstream results \
should be read with extra caution.

4. **Outlier detection needs a batch.** A heterozygosity outlier is only \
meaningful relative to a group of comparable samples; with few local samples no \
reliable outlier judgment can be made, and none is asserted.

5. **Not a clinical result.** These are research/educational data-quality \
metrics, not a clinical or diagnostic test.\

# ── Runs-of-Homozygosity (ROH / FROH) autozygosity metric ───────────────────

ROH_DISCLAIMER_TITLE = "About Runs of Homozygosity (FROH)"

ROH_DISCLAIMER_TEXT = """\
This section reports runs of homozygosity (ROH) — long stretches of the genome \
where both inherited copies are identical — and summarises them as FROH, a \
genome-wide estimate of autozygosity.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **FROH is an estimate, not a diagnosis.** It is a population-genetics metric \
describing how much of your genome falls in long homozygous runs. It is not a \
medical result and does not, by itself, indicate any health condition.

2. **It is not a statement about your parents.** Long runs of homozygosity arise \
from many benign causes — the history of your ancestral population, genuine \
ancestral isolation, and large stretches of the genome that simply recombine \
rarely. A given FROH value does not establish that your parents are related, and \
Yeliztli does not infer or report any such relationship.

3. **It is an array-based approximation.** The estimate depends on which \
positions the array typed and on the detection parameters used; sequencing-based \
methods can give different values. It is provided for genomic-ancestry context, \
not clinical use.

4. **Confirm clinically if relevant.** If you have a specific clinical question \
about recessive-condition risk, discuss it with a clinician or genetic counselor \
rather than relying on this estimate.

# ── LHON (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy) primary-mutation module ────────

LHON_DISCLAIMER_TITLE = "About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) Results"

LHON_DISCLAIMER_TEXT = """\
This section reports the three primary mitochondrial LHON mutations — MT-ND4 \
m.11778G>A (rs199476112), MT-ND1 m.3460G>A (rs199476118), and MT-ND6 m.14484T>C \
(rs199476104) — which together account for more than 90% of Leber hereditary \
optic neuropathy.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **A positive result is not a diagnosis or a prediction.** Penetrance is \
incomplete and strongly sex-biased: only about half of male carriers and roughly \
one in ten female carriers ever develop vision loss, and onset is often triggered \
by environmental factors such as smoking or heavy alcohol use. Most carriers keep \
normal vision for life.

2. **Maternally inherited.** Mitochondrial DNA passes only from mother to child. \
A variant here is shared with your maternal relatives but is not passed on by \
fathers — relevant information for the wider maternal family.

3. **Heteroplasmy is not measured.** Arrays give a single binary call and cannot \
measure heteroplasmy (the proportion of mitochondrial copies carrying the \
variant), which can influence whether and how severely vision is affected. Only \
quantitative clinical mitochondrial testing can establish it.

4. **Visual prognosis differs by variant.** m.14484T>C carries the best outlook, \
with spontaneous recovery seen in some affected individuals; m.11778G>A and \
m.3460G>A are associated with poorer spontaneous recovery.

5. **A negative result does not rule LHON out.** Rare and private LHON-causing \
variants exist beyond these three, and a position not present on the array is \
shown as indeterminate rather than negative. The absence of a finding is not a \
clean bill of health — clinical mitochondrial testing is the way to confirm.

6. **Confirm clinically.** This is a research/educational result, not a clinical \
test. Anyone with vision symptoms, or considering this information for family \
planning, should seek evaluation by an ophthalmologist or genetic counselor and \
confirmation in a CLIA/accredited laboratory.

MT_RNR1_DISCLAIMER_TEXT = """\
This section reports mitochondrial MT-RNR1 (12S rRNA) variants associated with \

(rs267606619), and m.1095T>C (rs267606618). Aminoglycosides are a class of \
antibiotics that includes gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and streptomycin.

**Please understand the following before reviewing:**

1. **Decision-support, not a prescription.** Where m.1555A>G or m.1494C>T is \
detected, the 2021 CPIC guideline recommends avoiding aminoglycoside antibiotics \
unless a severe infection and the lack of a safe, effective alternative outweigh \
the high risk of permanent hearing loss. Yeliztli does not start, stop, or change \
any medication — that decision belongs with your clinician or pharmacist, who can \
weigh it against your specific situation.

2. **Maternally inherited.** Mitochondrial DNA passes only from mother to child. \
A variant here is shared with your maternal relatives but is not passed on by \
fathers — relevant information for the wider maternal family.

3. **Heteroplasmy is not measured.** Arrays give a single mitochondrial call and \
cannot measure heteroplasmy (the proportion of mitochondrial copies carrying the \
variant). Penetrance can depend on that proportion, which only quantitative \
clinical mitochondrial testing can establish.

4. **Evidence differs by variant.** m.1555A>G and m.1494C>T have strong, \
family-study evidence; m.1095T>C is a weaker, preliminary association that needs \
further study.

5. **A negative result does not rule this out.** These positions are frequently \
not present on consumer arrays. A position that was not typed is shown as \
indeterminate, and the absence of a finding does not mean the variant is absent — \
clinical mitochondrial testing is the way to confirm.

6. **Confirm clinically.** This is a research/educational result, not a clinical \
test. Confirm in a CLIA/accredited laboratory before any medical action, and \
carry this information to medical encounters where antibiotics may be prescribed.
