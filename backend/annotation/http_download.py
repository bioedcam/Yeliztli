"""Resilient HTTP streaming download with retry + Range resume.

Large database downloads (dbNSFP ~47 GB, gnomAD, ClinVar, dbSNP, …) are long
enough that a transient TCP reset or an upstream closing the connection
mid-body is a *when*, not an *if*.  The naive ``client.stream`` loops that
used to live in each ``backend.annotation.*`` module had no recovery: a single
``httpx.RemoteProtocolError`` ("peer closed connection without sending complete
message body") threw away the whole partial transfer and failed the build.

:func:`stream_download` hardens that path while leaving the happy path
untouched:

* **Byte-exact streaming.** Requests are sent with ``Accept-Encoding: identity``
  and bytes are pulled with :meth:`httpx.Response.iter_raw`, so on-wire byte
  offsets match the file on disk and ``Range`` resumption is exact (no
  transparent gzip re-framing).
* **Resume, don't restart.** On a transient failure the partial ``.tmp`` is
  kept and the next attempt issues ``Range: bytes=<offset>-`` (guarded by
  ``If-Range`` against the first response's validator, so a rotated upstream
  artifact triggers a clean full restart instead of a corrupt splice).
* **Progress-aware retry budget.** The retry budget counts *consecutive
  attempts that made no forward progress*.  Any attempt that appends even one
  byte resets it, so a 47 GB transfer that drops every few GB still completes,
  while a genuinely stuck endpoint fails fast.
* **Completeness check.** A body that ends cleanly but short of the advertised
  ``Content-Length`` / ``Content-Range`` total is treated as a retryable
  failure rather than a silent truncation.

The happy path is a single streamed connection at the same chunk size as
before, so there is no throughput regression; retries and the size check only
cost anything when a transfer would otherwise have failed outright.

    By default the download starts fresh: any pre-existing ``tmp_path`` is
    removed first, so there is no risk of splicing onto a stale partial from an
    earlier (possibly different) URL, and the partial is also removed on
    permanent failure.  Resume happens *within* this call — partial progress
    survives transient failures and is continued via ``Range``.

    When ``resumable=True`` (used by :class:`~backend.db.download_manager.
    DownloadManager`, which tracks the URL↔partial mapping itself), a
    pre-existing ``tmp_path`` is continued via ``Range`` and the partial is
    *kept* on permanent failure so a later call can resume it.

    Args:
        url: Remote URL to download.
        tmp_path: Destination temp file.  The caller performs the atomic rename
            to the final path on success.
        progress_callback: Called with ``(file_offset, total_bytes|None)`` after
            each chunk, where ``file_offset`` is the current size of the partial
            file.  It increases monotonically during normal streaming and resumes,
            but resets to 0 and climbs again if the server forces a full restart
            (ignored ``Range`` / rotated resource) — i.e. it always reflects the
            true bytes-on-disk, which is what resume and checkpointing rely on.
        on_chunk: Optional lighter hook called with ``cumulative_bytes`` after
            each chunk (used by :class:`DownloadManager` for DB checkpointing).
        timeout: Total per-request timeout (seconds).
        connect_timeout: Connect timeout (seconds).
        read_timeout: Per-read timeout (seconds) — bounds a stalled socket.
        chunk_size: Streaming chunk size (bytes).
        max_retries: Consecutive no-progress attempts tolerated before failing.
        max_attempts: Absolute attempt ceiling regardless of progress.
        extra_headers: Extra request headers (merged; ``Range`` / ``If-Range`` /
            ``Accept-Encoding`` are managed internally).
        client_factory: Optional factory returning an ``httpx.Client`` (for
            tests / custom transports).  Defaults to a sensible client.
        sleep: Injectable sleep (tests pass a no-op to avoid real backoff waits).

    Returns:
