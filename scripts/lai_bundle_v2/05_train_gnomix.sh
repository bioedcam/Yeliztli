# Phase 5 — Train Gnomix per chromosome at array density.
#
# Input:
#   $PANEL_DIR/ref_panel_chr{N}.vcf.gz        (Phase 3)
#   $ADMIX_DIR/sample_map.txt                 (Phase 4)
#   $RAW_DIR/genetic_maps_gnomix/chr{N}.map  (Phase 1; TAB-delimited 3-col chrom/pos/cM for gnomix)
#   $GNOMIX_DIR_INSTALL/gnomix.py             (cloned from AI-sandbox/gnomix)
#
# Output:
#   $GNOMIX_DIR/output_chr{N}/                — pickled XGBoost models + config
#   $LOG_DIR/gnomix_train_chr{N}.log          — per-chrom training log
#
# Plan §6.4: phase unchanged from v1.1; models retrain against the larger
# window count (~30% bigger total). Bio-validator validates per-window
# accuracy ≥0.88 mean before publication.
#
# BUG F (FIXED — minimal-query): gnomix runs a post-train inference on the
# *query* AFTER it trains+saves the model. The v1.1 invocation passed the full
# ~4091-sample phasing panel as the query, so that tail re-phased all 4091
# haplotypes and HUNG for hours ("Phasing individual N/4091") even though the
# trained model_chm_chrN.pkl was already on disk (07b re-exports it; the
# inference output is unused). Training consumes only reference_file + sample_map
# (+ the seeded simulation in config.yaml, seed=94305), so the model is
# independent of the query. This script now passes a tiny 2-sample query (a
# strict subset of the panel -> identical sites) so the post-train inference is
# trivial and the SLURM array finishes on its own — no harvest babysitting, the
# afterok finish fires cleanly. phase=True is kept so the saved model still ships
# its phasing module for real unphased AncestryDNA uploads. (The EUR-fix rebuild
# instead HARVESTED each task — scancel once the model + "Estimated val accuracy"
# appeared, then ran finish directly — which remains a valid fallback.)

  # reference_file = the phased panel; query_file = the tiny $query_vcf built

  # + sys.exit(0): a SILENT no-op that set -e cannot catch (exit 0).
  # The 7-positional form (args 1-7) is the proven v1.1 production invocation
  # (phase=True, chr_nr="chr${chr}", reference=panel — confirmed against the

  # module for unphased query data).
